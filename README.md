# Sidebar Menu - HTML & CSS Project

This is a simple **Sidebar Menu** created using **HTML** and **CSS**. The project demonstrates how to build a clean, responsive sidebar navigation menu for websites. The sidebar is designed to slide in from the left and includes basic features such as hover effects, links, and smooth transitions.

## Project Overview

The Sidebar Menu includes the following features:
- **Responsive Design**: The sidebar adjusts based on the screen size and is fully functional on both desktop and mobile views.
- **Hover Effects**: Links within the sidebar change color when hovered over for an interactive feel.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The sidebar smoothly slides in and out when toggled, creating a pleasant user experience.
- **Simple Navigation**: Includes placeholder links that can be replaced with actual navigation items for real projects.

The goal of this project is to practice layout design and responsiveness using only **HTML** and **CSS** without the need for JavaScript.

## Features

- **Sidebar Toggle**: The sidebar can be toggled to open and close on smaller screens (mobile and tablet views).
- **Responsive Layout**: The sidebar adjusts to smaller screen sizes using media queries to ensure it works on all devices.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects for links inside the sidebar for better user interaction.
- **Smooth Slide Transition**: The sidebar transitions smoothly when toggled, giving the page a modern feel.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the sidebar and page layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the sidebar, applying hover effects, and making the layout responsive.
- **CSS Transitions**: For smooth sliding and hover effects.


## Usage

1. When the webpage is loaded, the sidebar will be on the left side of the screen.
2. On smaller screens, you can click the **hamburger menu** to toggle the sidebar (open/close).
3. The links inside the sidebar can be modified to point to actual pages or sections in your project.

## Future Enhancements

- **Add JavaScript**: Implement JavaScript for additional functionality, like closing the sidebar when clicking outside.
- **Add Submenus**: Introduce dropdown submenus to the sidebar for a more complex navigation system.
- **Improve Animation**: Add more sophisticated animations like sliding the content area when the sidebar is toggled.
- **Customization**: Allow the sidebar style (width, color, position) to be customized via CSS variables or user input.
